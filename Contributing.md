# ● Contributing
Thanks for taking your time to contribute to Broken Source Software projects!!

## ▸ Help Needed
- Designer needed for the logos

## ▸ Reporting Issues
- **We do not** test enough or at all the code on Windows or MacOS, you may need to follow instructions on debugging.
- Always give **minimal steps** to reproduce the error (instructions or code).
- Most projects deal with Audio or Video, issues may be file-specific.
- **We only support the latest versions of any given project**, BrokenSource is rolling-release model.

## ▸ Suggesting Enhancements
- Rejection of ideas in Free and Open Source Software is a common and intimidating problem to newcomers, so we want to reduce the fear and cooperate with you.
- Not all suggestions matches the project original idea.
- No commentaries are criticizing your person, rather your *work*.
- **Stuff needs time and effort to be implemented**, don't expect stuff to be coded immediately.
- Feel absolutely free to debate on choices and ideas for the projects.
