## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installing

!!! success "All Projects are contained on this single dependency"

!!! abstract "Install the Package"
    === "Pip"
        ```shell title="Command"
        python -m pip install broken-source
        ```

    === "Poetry"
        ```shell title="Command"
        python -m poetry add broken-source
        ```

    === "Rye"
        ```shell title="Command"
        rye add broken-source
        ```

    === "PDM"
        ```shell title="Command"

    1.  - No sense to me to force any of CUDA, CPU or ROCm
        - It's a large dependency and not always needed

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Usage
After **Installing** the Package, you can simply import it in your Code

```python
from DepthFlow import DepthFlowScene

depthflow = DepthFlowScene()
depthflow.input(image="./background.png")
depthflow.main(output="./video.mp4", ...)
```

.. or run its command line interface:

```shell title="Terminal"
# You can also use 'depthflow' instead of 'python -m DepthFlow'
python -m DepthFlow input -i ./background.png main -o ./video.mp4
```

- **For more,** go to the project tab of your interest above and see its usage

## üöÄ Upgrading

!!! abstract "Simply **upgrade the dependency** on your Python project"
    === "Pip"
        ```shell title="Command"
        python -m pip install --upgrade broken-source
        ```

    === "Poetry"
        ```shell title="Command"
        python -m poetry update broken-source
        ```

    === "Rye"
        ```shell title="Command"
        rye add broken-source
        ```

    === "PDM"
        ```shell title="Command"
        pdm update broken-source
        ```

!!! tip "**Consider** staying on a fixed version if you need stability"
    Small or breaking parts of the code can be changed on any new release

    - Define `broken-source==X.Y.Z` in `pyproject.toml` to pin it


## ‚ôªÔ∏è Uninstalling

!!! abstract "Simply **uninstall the package** on your Python Package Manager of choice"
    === "Pip"
        ```shell title="Command"
        python -m pip uninstall broken-source
        ```

    === "Poetry"
        ```shell title="Command"
        python -m poetry remove broken-source
        ```
