# ðŸ§­ Roadmap

I have a pretty decent vision for any **two next weeks** of development, and work based on **priorities** that would give the **most value** and **quality of life** to the Projects.

- Items may happen out of order, delayed, not at all, and retroactively apply
- Minor unlisted items may be worked on instead of listed ones

<hr>

## **Stage 1:** Low Hanging Fruits
!!! success "**Quality of Life** features for what works today"
- [x] Fastest Piano Roll code in Python in the world
- [ ] Code logistics for FFmpeg advanced and easy configuration
- [ ] Preset System for DepthFlow, CLI and API friendly
- [ ] Improve the Website and Documentation
- [ ] Better ShaderFlow Shader Library include file
- [ ] Improve User Experience on Pianola
- [ ] Make DepthFlow's logic extensible and usable on ShaderFlow

**Eta**: Q2 2024

## **Stage 2:** More Features
!!! example "**Get it Working**, move fast and break things"
- [ ] Internal rewrite and implementation of Imgui helpers for ShaderFlow
- [ ] (Re)writing all function docstrings for the Code Reference
- [ ] Rework ShaderFlow Shaders metaprogramming system
- [ ] Configurable Camera hotkeys for ShaderFlow
