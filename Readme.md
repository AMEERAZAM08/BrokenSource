This _mono_-repository hosts the **shared library** called **Broken** ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π (Rust and Python), a convenience script of the same name - `broken` - and **submodules** of **all our projects**

- **Broken** is a _Framework_ for all other projects, a solution to manage them all in a single place üåü

- **Broken** does a lot of things automatically for you, spend more time **using** the projects üöÄ

**Rust** projects might take longer to be developed and shall be the focus on the medium future, while **Python** projects are prototypes, mockups, proof-of-concepts or smaller projects and are the current focus

<sub>‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• We are Linux-first support üêß</sub>

# üì¶ Pre-compiled binaries

Head over to each project's **Releases** page and download the latest version for your platform if any available

Otherwise, you'll have to run from the source code, see below

- **Help needed**: Package managers for Linux and MacOS are welcome, you'll be credited ‚ù§Ô∏è

<sub><i><b>Warning for Windows:</b> Our binaries are 100% safe - you can read the source code - but are likely to be flagged dangerous by Windows Smart Screen, mistaken as a malware by your antivirus or blocked by Windows Defender, given enough people downloading and executing them. Code signing is expensive and we 1. Don't have a budget for it; 2. Are completelty Open Source, no shady between the lines stuff</i></sub>

<br>

Our **release binaries** follows the **naming convention** below:

- `$project_name-$operating_system-$cpu_architecture-$version.$extension`

where

<div align="center">

| **Variable**         | **Possible Values**         | **Notes**     |
|:--------------------:|:---------------------------:|:-------------:|
| `$project_name`      | Many                        | -             |
| `$operating_system`  | `linux`, `macos`, `windows` | _*1_          |
| `$cpu_architecture`  | `amd64`, `arm`              | _*1_          |
| `$version`           | `YYYY.MM.DD`                | _*2_          |
| `$extension`         | `.bin`, `.exe`              | Depends on OS |

</div>

We also provide a `.sha256` file for checksum for each binary for integrity verification

<sub><i>*1: We don't have the hardware to test on ARM or MacOS, so we can't provide binaries for those platforms. You likely can run from the source code</i></sub>

<sub><i>*2: Our versioning is based on a date format since most code is rolling release; we don't plan to have that many releases; they encode the rough timespan where the project was at and gets neatly sorted by name on file explorers</i></sub>

# üî• Running From the Source Code

Please read all instructions before executing them for tips and notes

**Common stuff** for all platforms:

- The pre-requirements are having [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) installed

<br>

## Linux and MacOS

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edent/SuperTinyIcons/master/images/svg/linux.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="82">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edent/SuperTinyIcons/master/images/svg/apple.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="82">

  **Linux** üíé **MacOS**
</div>

<sub><i><b>Note:</b> For MacOS, use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager if needed</i></sub>

- Open a Terminal on some directory and run:

```bash
# Clone and enter the repository directory
git clone https://github.com/BrokenSource/BrokenSource

# "Open" the repository folder
cd BrokenSource

# Install dependencies, activates virtual environment
python ./brakeit

# Clone submodules
broken clone
```

And done, you can now run `broken` and see all available commands: compile, release and run projects with ease!

<sub><b>Note:</b> On subsequent runs, open a terminal inside `BrokenSource` folder and execute `python ./brakeit` script again</sub>


<br>

## Windows

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edent/SuperTinyIcons/master/images/svg/windows.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="82">

  **Windows 10+**
</div>

A quick note based on the project language:

- Running the Python projects is **easy**, while Rust requires **extra steps**

- **Rust** is split in its own instructions to reduce micro-management and complexity


<details>
  <summary>
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Getting the error <i>"execution of scripts is disabled on this system"</i> ‚ùì
  </summary>

  Open a PowerShell terminal as Administrator and run:

  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  ```
</details>

<br>
<br>

Depending on the **project language** you want to run, follow the **instructions below**


<br>

## ‚Ä¢ Python Projects

Have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) installed

<sub><b>Note:</b> Be sure to mark the option to add Python to PATH</sub>

- **Windows 10**: `Shift+Right Click` some empty space in Windows Explorer
  - Select `Open PowerShell window here`

- **Windows 11**: `Right Click` some empty space in Windows Explorer
  - Select `Open in Terminal`

Now run the same **Linux** and **MacOS** commands above

<br>

## ‚Ä¢ Rust Projects

**Rust** requires quite some **dependencies** to be **installed** for a Windows release

Compiling "natively" requires installing manually Python, Git, CMake, MinGW GCC and GFortran, Visual Studio C++ Build Tools, not really easy but **doable if you want to try**

Easiest way is using [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) which provides an **Unix-like** environment for Windows, please install it

- Open a MSYS2 terminal and run:

```bash
# Install all required dependencies
pacman -S git python python-pip python-wheel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain libffi-devel zlib-devel
```

- Now follow the same **Linux** and **MacOS** instructions above

**Note**: Stuff will be downloaded to `C:\msys64\home\USERNAME\BrokenSource` on default configs

**Tip:** You can press `Shift+Insert` to paste stuff on the clipboard to MSYS2 terminal

<sub><i>Linux and terminal commands aren't that hard!.. see? üòâ</i></sub>

# ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Contributing
Thanks for taking your time to contribute to Broken Source Software projects!!

- Apart from the usual "be nice", "be respectful", we have some guidelines to help you get started

## ‚Ä¢ Help Needed
- Designer needed for the logos and consistent art
- Packaging binaries on Linux and MacOS package managers

## ‚Ä¢ Reporting Issues
- **We do not** test enough or at all the code on Windows or MacOS
- Always give **minimal steps** to reproduce the error (instructions or code)
- Most projects deal with Audio or Video, issues may be file-specific
- **We only support the latest versions of any given project**, we are rolling-release
  - <sub>We'll still help troubleshooting older code or releases, just don't except back-porting</sub>

## ‚Ä¢ Suggesting Enhancements
- Rejection of ideas on Free and Open Source Software is a common and intimidating problem to newcomers, so we want to reduce the fear and cooperate with you
- Not all suggestions matches the project original idea
- No commentaries are criticizing your person, rather your *work*
- **Stuff needs time and effort to be implemented**
- Feel absolutely free to debate on choices and ideas for the projects

# ‚öñÔ∏è License and Fair Use

**Basics**
- üìù All projects have their own license; unless specified in the code, asset file or `Readme.md` on the project's root or some other directory, all files are subject to the `License.md` on their respective repository

- üìà We embrace the **Open Source** philosophy; The **Free** part we hope that using more _"restrictive"_ licenses will help to keep the projects free from abuse. This being said, smaller projects tends to be MIT licensed since the effort is considerably lower


<br/>

**Legal Responsibilities**
- üß® We take **no responsibility** for any **damage** caused by the use of our projects on you or others, directly or indirectly

- üñã You are responsible for the **User Generated Content** you create, any copyright or law infringements are made by user inputs


<br/>

**Fair Use**
- üíù Projects takes many human-hours to be created, consider retributing the favor by **donating** if you can or made money with them, do **share** the projects with others

- üí∞ We are **not** against **Commercial** use, but we are against **abuse** of the projects and their code. Be fair, get in touch with us and we'll be happy to help both sides grow
