# 📦 About this PyPI Package
Until further **Code Logistics improvements**, this package contains all of my **Base Libraries** and **Projects**. This is a temporary solution to just _get it working_ and out there first

- Speed of changes and inter-dependencies are too high to micro-manage
- Expect in the future a refactor into many smaller packages
