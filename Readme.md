This _mono_-repository hosts the **üìö Shared Library** called **‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Broken**, a **üé© Manager Tool** of the same name, and **üì¶ Submodules** of all our **üíé Projects**. User first, trust and quality are our core values.

- **Framework**: A solution for project unification and consistency üåü

- **Automation**: Easy deploy, spend more time **using** the Projects üöÄ

# üî• Running From the Source Code

> **Please read all instructions** before executing them for tips, notes and troubleshooting

<br>

## ‚úÖ Linux and MacOS

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edent/SuperTinyIcons/master/images/svg/linux.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="82">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edent/SuperTinyIcons/master/images/svg/apple.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="82">

  **Linux** üíé **MacOS**
</div>

<sub><i><b>Note:</b> For MacOS, use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager if needed üç∫</i></sub>

- **Install** [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [**Python**](https://www.python.org/downloads) for your platform

- Open a **Terminal** on some directory and run:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/BrokenSource/BrokenSource
  ```
  ```bash
  python ./BrokenSource/brakeit
  ```

**And done**, you can now run `broken` and see all available commands üöÄ

- Head back to the *Project* you want to run for further instructions üç∑

<sub><b>Note:</b> On subsequent runs, open a terminal inside `BrokenSource` folder and execute `python ./brakeit` script again</sub>


<br>

## ‚úÖ Windows

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edent/SuperTinyIcons/master/images/svg/windows.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="82">

  **Windows 10+**
</div>

**Open** some folder you want to download the code to on **Windows Explorer**

- Press `Ctrl+L` to focus the address bar and type `cmd` to open a terminal

- **Install** [**Git for Windows**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) with the command:
  ```ps
  winget install -e --id Git.Git --source winget
  ```

- **Install** [**Python**](https://www.python.org/downloads) with the command:
  ```ps
  winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.11
  ```

**Now**, run the same **Linux** and **MacOS** commands above

<br>

<sub><b>Note:</b> You might need to replace `/` with `\` on the second command and `python` to `python3` or add `.exe` to it</sub>

<sub><b>Note:</b> You don't need to use Winget (it's more practical), you can manual install Python and Git following the links above</sub>


<br>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common** Troubleshooting

**Generic**:

<details>
  <summary>
    No such command <code>(project)</code> when running <code>broken (project)</code>
  </summary>
  <br>

  - Run `broken submodules` to clone all the public projects
  <br>
</details>

<br>

**Windows**:

<details>
  <summary>
    Shell Error: <i>execution of scripts is disabled on this system</i>
  </summary>
  <br>

  Following <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4038991"><b>This Answer</b></a>, Open a PowerShell terminal as Administrator and run:

  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  ```
  <br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli"><b>Winget</b></a> is not installed or available on your System
  </summary>
  <br>

  As [**Microsoft**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#install-winget) says in their documentation, you have options:

  - Install it from the [**Microsoft Store**](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NBLGGH4NNS1)

  - Open a PowerShell terminal and run:

  ```powershell
  Add-AppxPackage -RegisterByFamilyName -MainPackage Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller_8wekyb3d8bbwe
  ```
  <br>
</details>

# üì¶ Pre-compiled binaries

Head over to each project's **Releases** page and download the latest version for your platform if any available

Otherwise, you'll have to run from the source code

- **Help needed**: Package managers for Linux and MacOS are welcome, you'll be credited ‚ù§Ô∏è

Our **release binaries** follow the **naming convention** below:

- `$project_name-$operating_system-$cpu_architecture-$version.$extension`

where

<div align="center">

| **Variable**         | **Possible Values**         | **Notes**     |
|:--------------------:|:---------------------------:|:-------------:|
| `$project_name`      | Many                        | -             |
| `$operating_system`  | `linux`, `macos`, `windows` | _*1_          |
| `$cpu_architecture`  | `amd64`, `arm`              | _*1_          |
| `$version`           | `YYYY.MM.DD`                | _*2_          |
| `$extension`         | `.bin`, `.exe`              | Depends on OS |

</div>

We also provide a `.sha256` file for checksum for each binary for integrity verification

<sub><i>*1: We don't have the hardware to test on ARM or MacOS, so we can't provide binaries for those platforms. You likely can run from the source code</i></sub>

<sub><i>*2: Our versioning is based on a date format since most code is rolling release; we don't plan to have that many releases; they encode the rough timespan where the project was at and gets neatly sorted by name on file explorers</i></sub>

<sub><i><b>Warning for Windows:</b> Our binaries are 100% safe - you can read the source code - but are likely to be flagged dangerous by Windows Smart Screen, mistaken as a malware by your antivirus or blocked by Windows Defender, given enough people downloading and executing them. Code signing is expensive and we 1. Don't have a budget for it; 2. Are completely Open Source, no shady between the lines stuff</i></sub>

# üöß Hardware Requirements

<sup><b>Note</b>: This section is under construction</sup>

The faster the hardware (CPU, GPU, RAM), the faster the code will run.

Apart from memory restrictions your hardware should support some minimum technologies:

## Projects with PyTorch

## Projects with FFmpeg

# ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Contributing
Thanks for taking your time to contribute to Broken Source Software projects!!

- Apart from the usual "be nice", "be respectful", we have some guidelines to help you get started

## ‚Ä¢ Help Needed
- Designer needed for the logos and consistent art
- Packaging binaries on Linux and MacOS - package managers

## ‚Ä¢ Reporting Issues
- **We do not** test enough or at all the code on Windows or MacOS
- Always give **minimal steps** to reproduce the error (instructions or code)
- Most projects deal with Audio or Video, issues may be file-specific
- **We only support the latest versions of any given project**, we are rolling-release
  - <sub>We'll still help troubleshooting older code or releases, just don't except back-porting</sub>

## ‚Ä¢ Suggesting Enhancements
- Rejection of ideas on Free and Open Source Software is a common and intimidating problem to newcomers, so we want to reduce the fear and cooperate with you
- Not all suggestions matches the project original idea
- No commentaries are criticizing your person, rather your *work*
- **Stuff needs time and effort to be implemented**
- Feel absolutely free to debate on choices and ideas for the projects
- Do not be afraid to ask for help or guidance
