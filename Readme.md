  Here lies **‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Broken** (The **üìö Shared Library** and **üé© Manager**) + **üì¶ Submodules** of all our **üíé Projects**
</div>

- **üåü Framework**: A solution for Unification and Consistency

- **üöÄ Automation**: Spend more time **using** the Projects


<br>
<br>
<br>

# üî• Running From the Source Code

> **Please read all instructions** before executing them for tips, notes and troubleshooting

- The **brakeit** script does Sanity Checks, installs [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/), sets up and enter a Virtual Environment

- **Linux tip**: You can run `(project)er` for faster startup times after the first run, like `shaderflower`

- **Python 3.12** is supported, but might need compilers for some packages


<details>
  <summary>
    Don't want to use <code>brakeit.py</code> or <code>get.{sh,ps1}</code>?
  </summary>
  <br>
  If you already have Python and Git installed:

  <br>

  ```ps
  # Note: This flag is safe, users would `sudo pip` and break their system
  python -m pip install poetry --user --break-system-packages
  ```
  ```ps
  # Clone the Monorepo and all Submodules
  git clone https://github.com/BrokenSource/BrokenSource --recurse-submodules --jobs 4
  ```
  ```ps
  # Enter the Monorepo directory
  cd BrokenSource
  ```
  ```ps
  # Create the main Virtual Environment and install the dependencies
  python -m poetry install
  ```
  ```ps
  # Activate the main Virtual Environment
  python -m poetry shell
  ```
  ```ps
  # For calling `$project` other than `broken $project`
  broken scripts
  ```

## ‚úÖ Linux and MacOS

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edent/SuperTinyIcons/master/images/svg/linux.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="82">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edent/SuperTinyIcons/master/images/svg/apple.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="82">

  **Linux** üíé **MacOS**
</div>

<sub><i><b>Note:</b> For MacOS, use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager if needed üç∫</i></sub>

- **Install** [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [**Python 3.10 or 3.11**](https://www.python.org/downloads) for your platform

- Open a **Terminal** on some directory and run either command below

<br>

üöÄ Simplified:
  ```ps
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -sS https://brokensource.github.io/get.sh)"
  ```

<br>

üç∑ Traditional:
  ```ps
  git clone https://github.com/BrokenSource/BrokenSource --recurse-submodules --jobs 4

  python ./BrokenSource/brakeit.py
  ```

<br>

**And done**, now run `broken` for a Command List üöÄ

<br>

## ‚úÖ Windows

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edent/SuperTinyIcons/master/images/svg/windows.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="82">

  **Windows 10+**
</div>

**Open** some folder you want to download the code to on **Windows Explorer**

- Press `Ctrl+L` to focus the address bar and type `powershell` to open a Terminal and run

  ```ps
  irm https://brokensource.github.io/get.ps1 | iex
  ```

**And done**, now run `broken` for a Command List üöÄ

<br>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Traditional Method</b> - Alternative
  </summary>
  <br>

  - **Install** [**Git for Windows**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) with the command (once):
    ```ps
    winget install -e --id Git.Git --source winget
    ```

  - **Install** [**Python 3.11**](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.7/python-3.11.7-amd64.exe) with the command (once):
    ```ps
    winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.11 --scope=machine
    ```

  - **Reload** the Path with the command: (Or Restart the Terminal)
    ```ps
    $env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
    ```

  - **Clone** all Submodules and enter the Development Environment:
    ```ps
    git clone https://github.com/BrokenSource/BrokenSource --recurse-submodules --jobs 4
    ```
    ```ps
    python ./BrokenSource/brakeit.py
    ```
  <br>

  <sub><b>Note:</b> You might need to replace `/` with `\` on the second command, `python` to `python3` or add `.exe` to it</sub>

  <sub><b>Note:</b> You don't need to use Winget (it's more practical), you can manually install Python and Git following the links above</sub>
</details>


<br>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common** Troubleshooting

**Generic**:

<details>
  <summary>
    No such command <code>(project)</code> when running <code>broken (project)</code>
  </summary>
  <br>
  <hr>

  Likely a partial initialization of the submodules

  - Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` on the root directory to fix
  <hr>
  <br>
</details>

<br>

**Windows**:

<details>
  <summary>
    Shell Error: <i>execution of scripts is disabled on this system</i>
  </summary>
  <br>
  <hr>

  - This happens when activating a Python Virtual Environment - a `.ps1` script - from PowerShell

  - Following <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4038991"><b>This Answer</b></a>, Open a PowerShell terminal as <b>Administrator</b> and run:

  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  ```
  <hr>
  <br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli"><b>Winget</b></a> is not installed or available on your System
  </summary>
  <br>
  <hr>

  As [**Microsoft**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#install-winget) says in their documentation, you have options:

  - Install it from the [**Microsoft Store**](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NBLGGH4NNS1)

  - Open a PowerShell terminal and run:

  ```powershell
  Add-AppxPackage -RegisterByFamilyName -MainPackage Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller_8wekyb3d8bbwe
  ```
  <hr>
  <br>
</details>

# üì¶ Pre-compiled binaries

Head over to each project's **Releases** page and download the latest version for your platform, if available. Otherwise, you'll have to run directly from the Source Code

Our **release binaries** follow the **naming convention** below:

- `$project_name-$operating_system-$cpu_architecture-$version.$extension`

where

<div align="center">

| **Variable**         | **Possible Values**         | **Notes**     |
|:--------------------:|:---------------------------:|:-------------:|
| `$project_name`      | Many                        | -             |
| `$operating_system`  | `linux`, `macos`, `windows` | _*1_          |
| `$cpu_architecture`  | `amd64`, `arm`              | _*1_          |
| `$version`           | `YYYY.MM.DD`                | _*2_          |
| `$extension`         | `.bin`, `.exe`              | Depends on OS |

</div>

We also provide a `.sha256` file for checksum for each binary for integrity verification

- **Help needed**: Package managers for Linux and MacOS are welcome, you'll be credited ‚ù§Ô∏è

<br>

<sub><i>*1: We don't have the hardware to test on ARM or MacOS, so we can't provide binaries for those platforms. You likely can run from the source code</i></sub>

<sub><i>*2: We use date versioning as we are rolling release and is neatly sorted by name on file explorers</i></sub>

<sub><i><b>‚ö†Ô∏è Warning for Windows:</b> Our binaries are 100% safe - you can read the source code - but are likely to be flagged dangerous by Windows Smart Screen, mistaken as a malware by your antivirus or blocked by Windows Defender, given enough people downloading and executing them. Code signing is expensive and we 1. Don't have a budget for it; 2. Are completely Open Source, no shady between the lines stuff</i></sub>

# üöß Hardware Requirements

<sup><b>Note</b>: This section is under construction</sup>

**Golden Rule:** The faster the hardware (CPU, GPU, RAM), the faster the code will run.

Apart from memory restrictions your hardware should support some minimum technologies:

## Projects with PyTorch

## Projects with FFmpeg



<br>
<br>
<br>

# üíé Acknowledgements

All the infrastructure in **Broken Source Software's Framework** and **Projects** wouldn't be possible without many Programming Language Packages, Software we use and exponentially more **Open Source Contributors** that made it possible. **To all of you**, an **uncountable list of direct and indirect contributors**, we thank you for your time and effort to make the world a better place ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

- üìà We hope that using more _"restrictive"_ licenses will keep the projects free from abuse. A feedback loop of **sharing** and **improving**

- üçª You may contribute or use any project as long as you adhere to the **License** and **Terms**
