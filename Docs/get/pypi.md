!!! info annotate "(1) **Some Projects** or (2) **Optionals** require [**PyTorch**](https://pytorch.org/) separately due (3) **Reasons**"

1.  Like [**DepthFlow**](https://github.com/BrokenSource/DepthFlow)
2.  Like [**ShaderFlow.Optional.Monocular**](https://github.com/BrokenSource/ShaderFlow)
3.  - Different flavors exists, no sense to force any of CUDA, CPU or ROCm on all users
    - It's a large dependency and not always needed
