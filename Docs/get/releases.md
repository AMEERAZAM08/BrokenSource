## ⚡️ Installing

- I make **Self-installing** executables using [**PyApp**](https://github.com/ofek/pyapp) for your Convenience!

## 📛 Naming Convention

Our **release binaries** follow the **naming convention** below:

- `$project_name-$flavor-$operating_system-$cpu_architecture-$version.$extension`

where

| **Variable**         | **Possible Values**         | **Notes**     |
|:--------------------:|:---------------------------:|:-------------:|
| `$project_name`      | Many                        | -             |
| `$flavor`            | Often empty                 | _*1_          |
| `$operating_system`  | `linux`, `macos`, `windows` | _*2_          |
| `$cpu_architecture`  | `amd64`, `arm`              | _*2_          |
| `$version`           | `YYYY.MM.DD`                | _*3_          |
| `$extension`         | `.bin`, `.exe`              | Depends on OS |

We also provide a `.sha256` file for checksum for each binary for integrity verification

- **Help needed**: Package managers for Linux and MacOS are welcome, you'll be credited ❤️

<sub><i>*1: Some projects might use PyTorch and include `cpu`, `cuda` or `rocm` flavors</i></sub>

<sub><i>*2: We don't have the hardware to test on ARM or MacOS, so we can't provide binaries for those platforms. You likely can run from the source code</i></sub>

<sub><i>*3: We use date versioning as we are rolling release and is neatly sorted by name on file explorers</i></sub>

<sub><i><b>⚠️ Warning for Windows:</b> Our binaries are 100% safe - you can read the source code - but are likely to be flagged dangerous by Windows Smart Screen, mistaken as a malware by your antivirus or blocked by Windows Defender, given enough people downloading and executing them. Code signing is expensive and we 1. Don't have a budget for it; 2. Are completely Open Source, no shady between the lines stuff</i></sub> -->
